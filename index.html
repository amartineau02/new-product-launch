      <h2>Random Selection</h2>
      <div class="overlay-content">
        <p>If the next prompt in the book just isn’t getting the gears turning, close your eyes and randomly select a prompt! It might take a few tries (if you land on one you’ve already completed), but limit yourself and select the first one that gives you even the slightest bit of a creative spark.</p>

    <div class="card oc">
      <h2>Get Creative About It</h2>
      <div class="overlay-content">
        <p>Sometimes the prompts are on more serious topics, and we might not be comfortable writing our own thoughts about it. Change it up and write from the point of view of someone other than yourself! Whether it’s an original character of yours, your favorite TV show antagonist, or more — try a different perspective and see where the creative flow takes you.</p>

    <div class="card continue">
      <h2>Continue the Story</h2>
      <div class="overlay-content">
        <p>If you’re stuck on where to begin for a certain prompt, try linking it to one you’ve already completed. From there you could make it a story. Starting somewhere even somewhat familiar could help get those gears turning.</p>
